Exercise 2
** Create a figure object and put two axes on it, ax1 and ax2. Located at [0,0,1,1] and [0.2,0.5,.2,.2] respectively.**
** Now plot (x,y) on both axes. And call your figure object to show it.**
fig = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig.add_axes([0,0,1,1])
ax2 = fig.add_axes([0.2,0.5,0.2,0.2])
ax1.plot(x,y)
ax2.plot(x,y)

Exercise 3
** Create the plot below by adding two axes to a figure object at [0,0,1,1] and [0.2,0.5,.4,.4]**
** Now use x,y, and z arrays to recreate the plot below. Notice the xlimits and y limits on the inserted plot:**

Exercise 4
** Use plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2) to create the plot below.**
** Now plot (x,y) and (x,z) on the axes. Play around with the linewidth and style**
** See if you can resize the plot by adding the figsize() argument in plt.subplots() are copying and pasting your previous code.**
